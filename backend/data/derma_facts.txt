The skin consists of three primary layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue.
The epidermis serves as the protective outer barrier and is composed mainly of keratinocytes.
Melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis produce melanin, which gives skin its color and protects against UV radiation.
The dermis contains connective tissue, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and sweat glands.
Collagen and elastin fibers in the dermis provide structural support and elasticity to the skin.
The subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, contains fat and connective tissue that insulates and cushions the body.
Skin acts as a barrier to protect the body from pathogens, chemicals, and physical injury.
The skin helps regulate body temperature through sweat production and blood flow regulation.
Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, an oily substance that helps lubricate and protect the skin.
Common dermatological conditions include acne, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and skin infections.
Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory condition of the pilosebaceous unit, commonly seen in adolescents.
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin.
Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition resulting in the rapid buildup of skin cells, leading to scaling and inflammation.
Contact dermatitis occurs when the skin comes into contact with an irritant or allergen, causing redness, itching, and rash.
Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer and typically presents as a pearly or waxy bump on sun-exposed areas.
Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the squamous cells of the epidermis and often presents as a scaly, red patch or ulcer.
Malignant melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer arising from melanocytes and is characterized by asymmetrical, irregularly bordered, multicolored lesions.
The ABCDE rule is used to evaluate moles for melanoma: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter over 6 mm, and Evolving.
Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is a major risk factor for skin cancer and photoaging.
Sunscreen with broad-spectrum protection and SPF 30 or higher is recommended for daily use to prevent UV damage.
Skin biopsies are commonly performed to diagnose skin lesions and rashes.
Topical corticosteroids are frequently used to treat inflammatory skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis.
Systemic treatments for severe dermatologic conditions include immunosuppressants, biologics, and retinoids.
Fungal skin infections include tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea pedis (athlete's foot), and tinea versicolor.
Bacterial skin infections include impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas.
Viral skin infections include herpes simplex, varicella-zoster (chickenpox and shingles), and molluscum contagiosum.
Warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and commonly occur on hands and feet.
Alopecia is the medical term for hair loss and can be caused by autoimmune disease, genetics, or medications.
Vitiligo is an autoimmune condition resulting in the loss of melanocytes, causing depigmented patches on the skin.
Rosacea is a chronic skin condition characterized by facial redness, flushing, and visible blood vessels.
Hyperpigmentation occurs when excess melanin is produced, often due to inflammation, sun exposure, or hormonal changes.
Hypopigmentation is the loss of skin pigment and may result from injury, infection, or autoimmune conditions.
Skin aging is influenced by intrinsic factors (genetics) and extrinsic factors (UV exposure, smoking).
Proper skin hygiene includes gentle cleansing, moisturizing, and sun protection.
Dermatologists perform procedures such as cryotherapy, laser therapy, and excisions to treat various skin conditions.
Patch testing is used to identify allergens responsible for contact dermatitis.
Dermatoscopy is a non-invasive technique used to examine pigmented skin lesions more closely.
Chronic wounds, such as diabetic ulcers and pressure sores, require specialized wound care management.
Scabies is a contagious skin infestation caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite and presents with intense itching and burrows.
Lichen planus is an inflammatory condition affecting the skin, mucous membranes, hair, and nails, often presenting as purplish, itchy, flat-topped bumps.
Systemic lupus erythematosus can cause a characteristic butterfly-shaped rash on the face and other cutaneous manifestations.
Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic disorders characterized by fragile skin that blisters easily in response to minor injury.
Acne is a common skin condition that causes pimples, usually on the face, chest, and back. It can be treated with creams like benzoyl peroxide or medications like antibiotics.
Psoriasis causes thick, scaly patches on the skin and can be managed with creams to reduce inflammation or special medicines that calm the immune system.
Eczema (atopic dermatitis) makes the skin dry, itchy, and red. Moisturizers and steroid creams are commonly used to relieve symptoms.
Skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma often appears as a shiny bump or sore that doesn't heal. It is usually removed with minor surgery.
Melanoma is a serious skin cancer that often looks like a new or changing mole. Early removal with surgery gives the best chance of cure.
Ringworm is a fungal infection that causes a red, ring-shaped rash. It is treated with antifungal creams.
Rosacea causes redness and visible blood vessels on the face, sometimes with bumps. Treatment includes special creams or antibiotics.
Dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis causes flaky, itchy skin on the scalp and face. It can be treated with medicated shampoos.
Vitiligo causes white patches on the skin when pigment cells are lost. Treatment may include creams or light therapy to help even out skin color.
Contact dermatitis happens when the skin reacts to something it touches, like soap or metal, causing redness and itching. It gets better by avoiding the trigger and using soothing creams.
Hidradenitis suppurativa causes painful lumps and boils, usually under the arms or around the groin. Treatment includes antibiotics and sometimes surgery.
Actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly spot caused by too much sun exposure. It can be frozen off or treated with creams to prevent skin cancer.
Lichen planus causes itchy, purple bumps on the skin or in the mouth. It is treated with anti-inflammatory creams.
Alopecia areata is a condition where the immune system attacks hair follicles, causing bald patches. Treatment can include steroid injections to help the hair grow back.
Warts are caused by a virus and can be treated by freezing, applying special medicines, or minor surgery.
Cold sores are blisters caused by a virus and often appear on the lips. They can be treated with antiviral creams or pills.
Shingles causes a painful rash, often on one side of the body, and is treated with antiviral medication if caught early.
Hives are itchy welts that can appear suddenly and are often triggered by allergies. Antihistamine pills can help reduce the itching.
Scabies is an infestation of tiny mites that burrow into the skin, causing intense itching. It is treated with special creams that kill the mites.
Moles should be checked if they change in size, shape, or color, as they might be a sign of skin cancer.
Sunburn causes red, painful skin and can be prevented with sunscreen. Severe sunburn may need soothing lotions or medical care.
Ingrown hairs happen when hair grows back into the skin, causing bumps. Exfoliating the skin and using proper shaving techniques can help.
Fungal nail infections cause thick, discolored nails and are treated with antifungal creams or pills.
Skin tags are harmless growths that can be removed if they bother you.
Stretch marks are lines on the skin from rapid growth or weight changes. Creams can help, but they often fade over time on their own.
Keratosis pilaris causes tiny bumps on the arms or thighs and can be improved with moisturizing creams and gentle exfoliation.
